# Learn Python Basics by Building a Blackjack Game

You are going to build a blackjack card game in Python.

Every card in blackjack has a suit, rank, and value. For example, the king of hearts has a rank of "king", a suit of "hearts", and a value of 10 (In blackjack, face cards are worth 10).

## 10. Create a string variable

[placeholder]

### 10.1

Let's represent the king of hearts with Python code. Variables store data. The code already has a variable named `suit` that is set to the value of "hearts". Add a variable named `rank` and set it to the value of "K" (for king).

#### HINTS

- Check your spacing and capitalization.

## 20. Create a number variable

### 20.1

When variables are set to equal a string, the string should be surrounded by quotation marks. If a variable equals a number, quotation marks are not used around the number. Add a variable named `value` and set it to 10.

#### HINTS

- Check your spacing and capitalization.


## 30. Print to console

[placeholder]

### 30.1

The code `print("Hello world")` calls the `print()` function and prints the text "Hello World" to the console. Print the the text "Your card is:" to the console.

## 40. Run the blackjack.py file

[placeholder]

### 40.1

Most of the time you will be typing into the `blackjack.py` file window. When you want to run your program you will have to type into the terminal window. To run your code so far, enter `python blackjack.py` into the terminal and press enter.

#### HINTS

- Make sure you're in the `project` folder.
