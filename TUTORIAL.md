# Blackjack Game

You are going to build a blackjack card game in Python.

Every card in blackjack has a suit, rank, and value. For example, the king of hearts has a rank of "king", a suit of "hearts", and a value of 10 (In blackjack, face cards are worth 10).

## 10. Create a string variable

### 10.1

Let's represent the king of hearts with Python code. Variables store data. The code already has a variable named `suit` that is set to the value of "hearts". Add a variable named `rank` and set it to the value of "K" (for king).

#### HINTS

- Check your spacing and capitalization.
- Spelling must be exact.

## 20. Create a number variable

### 20.1

When variables are set to equal a string, the string should be surrounded by quotation marks. If a variable equals a number, quotation marks are not used around the number. Add a variable named `value` and set it to 10.

#### HINTS

- Numbers don't need quotation marks around them.
- Check your spacing and capitalization.


## 30. Print to console

### 30.1

The code `print("Hello world")` calls the `print()` function and prints the text "Hello World" to the console. Print the the text "Your card is:" to the console.

#### HINTS

- Make sure you are printing this string exactly: "Your card is:"
- The string must be in quotation marks and inside parenthesis.

## 40. Run the blackjack.py file

### 40.1

Most of the time you will be typing into the `blackjack.py` file window. When you want to run your program you will have to type into the terminal window. To run your code so far, enter `python blackjack.py` into the terminal and press enter.

For terminal tests to work, you will have to run the following line once before any other commands: `source ~/.bashrc`

#### HINTS

- Make sure you're in the `project` folder. 

## 50. Print a variable

### 50.1

Instead of passing in a string to the `print()` function (i.e. "Your card is:"), you can also pass in a variable and the value of the variable will print to the console. Print the value of the `rank` variable to the console.

#### HINTS

- The variable name should not have parenthesis around it.

## 60. Concatenate strings with +

### 60.1

The `+` operator can concatenate strings and/or variables together. Update your code so that the `print()` function is only called one time. It should print the following text to the console, using a variable for the rank: "Your card is: K"

#### HINTS

- ```  
name = "Quincy"  
print("My name is " + name)  
```  
That would print "My name is Quincy" to the console.
