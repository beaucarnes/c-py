You will use classes to model three parts of the game: Card, Deck, and Hand. So far, you've mainly worked on elements of the `Deck` class.\n\nRight after the `import` statement at the top, add this line: `class Deck:`. Then, highlight all the code after that line and hit the \"Tab\" key on your keyboard. This will indent all the code and make it part of the `Deck` class.\n\nAfter creating the `Deck` class, remove the unneeded code in the class by removing the last three lines of code (starting with the line `shuffle()`)",

Soon, you will see an example of what all this means so it will be easier to understand.\n\nFirst, let's prepare our class to create an instance from it. When you create an instance of a class, Python automatically calls a function (also called a method) in the class named `__init__`. The contents of this method should be code that is run one time to initialize the instance. Define this function by adding the following line of code directly under `class Deck:`: `def __init__(self):`.
